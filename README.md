Analysis of a cross-modal attention task

Analysis of a Cross-Modal Attention Task, with concurrent EEG. Participants differentiated spatial frequency patches (visual modality) and the frequency of different tones (auditory modality). Participants completed 2 sets of trials. One without and one with a sustained heat pain elicited by a thermode on a patch of skin containing capsicasun.

This R project is mainly concerned with processing the beahvioural data. However, some analysis of EEG measurse (after being extracted in MATLAB) will be completed here.
